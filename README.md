# UAC-BOF-Bonanza
This repository serves as a collection of public UAC bypass techniques that have been weaponized as BOFs. A single module which integrates all techniques has been provided to use the BOFs via the [Havoc C2 Framework](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc). A `extension.json` file has also been provided for each bypass technique for use in [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver). See the section of the readme titled [Greetz/Credit](https://github.com/icyguider/UAC-BOF-Bonanza#greetzcredit) for all references/code that was used in this project.

| UAC Bypass | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CmstpElevatedCOM` | Creates an elevated ICMLuaUtil COM object and calls its `ShellExec` function to execute the provided file on disk. |
| `ColorDataProxy` | Creates an elevated ICMLuaUtil COM object and calls its `SetRegistryStringValue` function to write the location of the provided file to the `DisplayCalibrator` registry value residing in HKLM. It will then create an elevated IColorDataProxy COM object and call its `LaunchDccw` function, resulting in the execution of the provided file. |
| `EditionUpgradeManager` | Modifies the "Environment\windir" registry key, creates a elevated IEditionUpgradeManager COM object, and then calls the `AcquireModernLicenseWithPreviousId` function from the elevated COM object to execute the provided file. |
| `SilentCleanupWinDir` | Modifies the "Environment\windir" registry key and executes the SilentCleanup scheduled task via schtasksrun by [@TrustedSec](https://twitter.com/TrustedSec). |
| `RegistryShellCommand` | Modifies the "ms-settings\Shell\Open\command" registry key and executes an auto-elevated EXE (ComputerDefaults.exe). |
| `TrustedPathDLLHijack` | Creates fake windows directory `C:\Windows \`, copies supplied DLL to location, and executes auto-elevated EXE (ComputerDefaults.exe). | 
| `SspiUacBypass` | Forges a token from a fake network authentication though SSPI Datagram Contexts. It will then impersonate the forged token and use CreateSvcRpc by [@x86matthew](https://twitter.com/x86matthew) to create a new SYSTEM service. Original research and code is from [@splinter_code](https://twitter.com/splinter_code). |

The BOFs can be utilized by running their corresponding subcommands in the Havoc C2 module. To use, simply run `make` and then load the module into Havoc using the script manager. See below for usage information and examples:

Additionally, `extension.json` files have been provided for each UAC bypass method if you wish to use them with Sliver C2. See below for sample instructions on how to load and use the extensions:
```
# CD into the extension folder and run make install
cd -rp ~/dev/UACBypasses/SspiUacBypass/; make install
# From sliver client cli, load extension by providing new path
extensions load /root/.sliver-client/extensions/sspidatagram
```

</details>

Finally, standalone implementations of each UAC bypass have also been provided. These will automatically be built by mingw when running the `make` command.

### OpSec/Usage Considerations
* All UAC bypasses were tested and confirmed working on Windows 11 (23H2) and Windows 10 (22H2).
* As these are all public UAC bypass techniques, their behavior should be detected by most competent SOCs and EDR solutions. See [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/exploring-windows-uac-bypasses-techniques-and-detection-strategies) from Elastic demonstrating detections for multiple bypasses in this project.
* This is a random project you found on GitHub. Read the source code and confirm it's up to your standards before using. If you notice anything in the code that could cause stability issues, feel free to post a pull request that fixes it.
